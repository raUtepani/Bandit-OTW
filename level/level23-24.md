# Bandit Level 22 → Level 23


# Goal
> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in `/etc/cron.d/` for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

`NOTE`: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

`NOTE 2`: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…
