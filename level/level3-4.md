# Bandit Level 3 â†’ Level 4


## Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a `hidden file` in the `inhere directory`.


## How to read content of Hidden file
In Linux, files that begin with a dot (.) are considered hidden. They are not displayed by default when you use the ls command. To view hidden files, you must use the `-a` or `-al` flag.
Notice how its name begins with a .? This character is telling us that the file is hidden. This is common for all Unix-like operating systems: whenever a file is to be treated as hidden, we rename it by prepending a . character to its name.

We can directly use cat to the hidden file or use `./` which ensures the shell treats it as a filename in the current directory, not as a special pattern.
```bash
cat .hidden
```

```bash
cat ./.hidden
```
